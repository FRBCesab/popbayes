The goal of the R package `popbayes` is to fit population trend over time under
a Bayesian framework. Population size is considered as individuals counts 
(not densities) collected at different dates. The package can deal with multiple
species surveyed at different locations but each **counts series** (one species 
at one location) will be processed independently.

The strength of `popbayes` is to take into account counts collected by different 
type of surveys (aerial vs ground surveys) estimated by different census methods 
(total counts, guesstimates [i.e. expert estimation], and sampling).



<br />

**Before using this package, users need to install the freeware 
[JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/).**

<br />


The workflow of `popbayes` consists in three main steps:

1. Formatting data (`format_data()`)
2. Fitting trend model (`fit_trend()`)
3. Visualizing results (`plot_trend()`)

The package also provides a lot of functions to handle individuals counts series 
and model outputs. The following figure shows a more complete usage of the 
workflow.

## The Garamba dataset



The package `popbayes` comes with an example dataset: `garamba`. It contains 
individuals counts for 10 African mammals species surveyed in the Garamba 
National Park (Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 1976 to 2017.


<br />

```{r 'load-data'}
data("garamba")
```

<br />

```{r 'print-data', echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(garamba, 15), caption = "The Garamba dataset (first rows)", 
             align = c("c", "l", "c", "c", "c", "r", "r", "r"))
```


<br />


This dataset has a typical structure with a location field (`location`), a 
species name field (`species`), a date field (`year`), and an individuals counts
field (`counts`). 


<br />

**Statistical method**

A fourth field is **mandatory**: `stat_method`. This column specifies the 
sampling method used to estimate individuals counts. This can be `T` for total 
counts, `G` for guesstimate (i.e. expert estimation), or `S` for sampling method.

To be usable by the Bayesian model, individuals counts data must be accompanied 
by information on precision expressed as a 95% confident interval. If:

- counts are `T` or `G`, users **do not need** to provide any information on 
counts precision. This confident interval will be computed by the 
function `format_data()` following these two equations:

$$ CI_{(T)} = [\ 0.95 \times counts\ ; 1.20 \times counts\ ] $$
$$ CI_{(G)} = [\ 0.80 \times counts\ ; 1.20 \times counts\ ] $$

- counts are `S`, users **need to specify** a measure of precision. Precision 
is preferably provided in the form of a 95% CI by means of two fields: `lower_ci` 
and `upper_ci` (as in the `garamba` dataset). Alternatively it may also be given 
in the form of a standard deviation (`sd`), a variance (`var`), or a 
coefficient of variation (`cv`). Note that precision metrics can be different 
between counts. For instance, some `S` counts can have an `sd` value and others 
`lower_ci` and `upper_ci`. In that case three precision columns will be required
(`lower_ci`, `upper_ci`, and `sd`). 


<br />

**Field method**

Another **optional** column, `field_method`, can be provided. It refers to the 
type of survey used to collect data. This can be `A` for aerial survey or `G` for 
ground survey. This information is required if counts in a same series come 
from different methods (both `A` and `G`).

The detectability of a species is strongly dependent on the survey method and
each species has its own _preferred field method_. So it is recommended to provide
the column `field_method` if counts have been collected under the non-preferred 
field method of the species (even if a series has the same `field_method`).


<br />

**Counts conversion**

The function `format_data()` will convert counts data (and 95% CI values) to their 
equivalent in the preferred field method of the species. To do so, users 
**need to provide** two counts conversion information:

- `pref_field_method`: the preferred field method of the species (`A` or `G`)
- `conversion_fact`: a multiplicative factor used to convert counts data

The package `popbayes` provides the `conversion_data` dataset. It contains
these two information for 15 African mammals species.


<br />

```{r 'load-data-2'}
data("conversion_data")
```

<br />

```{r 'print-data-2', echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(conversion_data[ , c(3, 6, 7, 8)], caption = "Counts conversion data available in popbayes", 
             align = c("l", "c", "c", "r"))
```

<br />

If users work with these species, the package `popbayes` will retrieve the values
of `pref_field_method` and `conversion_fact` from this dataset. But if some species
are absent from this dataset, users **need to provide** their values when running
`format_data()`. These values can be added in the counts dataset (Garamba) but 
we recommend to create an additional table and to pass it to the function 
`format_data()` with the argument `info`.

Let's take an example and let's assume that _Alcelaphus buselaphus_ is absent 
from `conversion_data`.


```{r 'create-info'}
## Remove Alcelaphus buselaphus (for the example) ----
info <- conversion_data[-2, c("species", "pref_field_method", "conversion_fact")]

## Add new species ----
conversion_info <- data.frame("species"           = "Alcelaphus buselaphus",
                              "pref_field_method" = "G",
                              "conversion_fact"   = 2.302)

## Append new species ----
conversion_info <- rbind(info, conversion_info)
conversion_info
```

<br />

How to find the counts conversion factor of a species? The dataset `conversion_data` 
contains the field `category`. The counts conversion factor is in fact specific 
to a group of species rather than a species. Theses species categories are based on 
the detectability of the species.

The package `popbayes` lists five species categories:

- **MLB**: Medium-sized Light and Brown species (20-150kg)
- **LLB**: Large Light and Brown species (>150kg)
- **LD**: Large Dark (>150kg)
- **Elephant**
- **Giraffe**



<br />



## Checking data


Before going any further, let's check the Garamba dataset. In particular we need 
to check `location` and `species` spelling, `year` and `counts` field format, 
and the `stat_method` and `field_method` categories.


<br />

**Check `location` field**

```{r 'check-location'}
unique(garamba$"location")

sum(is.na(garamba$"location"))   # Is there any missing values?
```

Field **`location`** can be either a `character` or a `factor`. It **cannot** 
contain any `NA` values.


<br />

**Check `species` field**

```{r 'check-species'}
unique(garamba$"species")

sum(is.na(garamba$"species"))   # Is there any missing values?

## Are there species absent from the 'conversion_data' popbayes dataset?
garamba_species <- unique(garamba$"species")
garamba_species[which(!(garamba_species %in% conversion_data$"species"))]
```

Field **`species`** can be either a `character` or a `factor`. It **cannot** 
contain any `NA` values.


<br />

**Check `year` field**

```{r 'check-year'}
is.numeric(garamba$"year")     # Are years in a numerical format?

sum(is.na(garamba$"year"))     # Is there any missing values?

range(garamba$"year")          # What is the temporal extent?
```

Field **`year`** must be a `numeric`. It **cannot** contain any `NA` values.

<br />

If you have a date (e.g. '2021/05/19') you need to convert it into a numeric 
format. For instance:

```{r 'convert-date'}
## Convert a character to a date object ----
x <- as.Date("2021/05/19")
x

## Convert a date to a numeric (number of days since 1970/01/01) ----
x <- as.numeric(x)
x

## Check ----
as.Date(x, origin = as.Date("1970/01/01"))
```

Others methods exist to convert a `date` to a `numeric` format. You may prefer 
computing the number of days since the first date of your survey. It's up to you.


<br />

**Check `counts` field**

```{r 'check-counts'}
is.numeric(garamba$"counts")   # Are counts in a numerical format?

range(garamba$"counts")        # What is the values range?

sum(is.na(garamba$"counts"))   # Is there any missing values?
```

Field **`counts`** must be a **positive** `numeric` (zero counts are allowed).
You can deal with `NA` counts later in the `format_data()` function.


<br />

**Check `stat_method` field**

```{r 'check-stat'}
unique(garamba$"stat_method")

sum(is.na(garamba$"stat_method"))   # Is there any missing values?
```

Field **`stat_method`** can be either a `character` or a `factor`. It **must**
contain only `T`, `G`, or `S` categories and **cannot** contain any `NA` values.


<br />

**Check `field_method` field**

```{r 'check-field'}
unique(garamba$"field_method")

sum(is.na(garamba$"field_method"))   # Is there any missing values?
```

Field **`field_method`** can be either a `character` or a `factor`. It **must**
contain only `A`, or `T` categories and **cannot** contain any `NA` values.



<br />



## Formatting data

This first `popbayes` function we will used is `format_data()`. This function 
provides an easy way to get individuals counts series ready to be analyzed by 
the package. It must be **used prior to** all other functions.


<br />

First let's define the path (relative or absolute) to save objects/results.

```{r 'define-path-1', eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
path <- tempdir()
```

```{r 'define-path-2', eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
path <- "the_folder_to_store_outputs"
```


<br />

The function `format_data()` has many arguments to provide columns names in the
users dataset like `location`, `species`, `lower_ci`, etc. By default columns
names are the same as in the Garamba dataset. If your location field
is "site", you'll need to use the argument `location` as follow: 
`location = "site"`.


<br />

```{r 'format-data'}
garamba_formatted <- popbayes::format_data(data = garamba, path = path)
```

<br />


As said above if you have to add your own counts conversion data you will use
the argument `info`.

<br />

Let's explore the output.

```{r 'explore-series'}
## Class of the object ----
class(garamba_formatted)

## Number of elements (i.e. number of counts series) ----
length(garamba_formatted)

## Get series names ----
popbayes::list_series(path)
```

<br />

Let's work with the counts series `"garamba__alcelaphus_buselaphus"`. We can use
the function `filter_series()`.

```{r 'filter-series'}
## Retrieve series by species and location ----
a_buselaphus <- popbayes::filter_series(data     = garamba_formatted, 
                                        species  = "Alcelaphus buselaphus",
                                        location = "Garamba")
```

<br />

Let's display the series content.

```{r 'print-series'}
print(a_buselaphus)
```

<br />

The first elements of the list provide a summary of the counts series.

If we compare the two last data frame (`data_original` and `data_converted`), 
there are not identical. The function `format_data()` has **1)** computed the 
95% CI boundaries for total counts (coded `T` in the column `stat_method`), and 
**2)** converted all counts (and CI boundaries) to their equivalent in the 
preferred field method (from `A` to `G`) by applying the conversion factor of 
`2.302`.

The Bayesian model will use counts and precision measures from the `data_converted`
data frame.

<br />

Before fitting the model we can visualize the counts series with `plot_series()`.

<br />

```{r 'plot-series-1', fig.width=12, fig.height=6, out.width="100%"}
popbayes::plot_series("garamba__alcelaphus_buselaphus", path = path)
```

<br />



The function `format_data()` has also exported series lists as `.RData` files in the
`path` folder. This folder contains sub-folders named after series names (one by series)
in which one `*_data.RData` file has been created.


```{r 'list-folder-1', echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
list.files(path, recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r 'list-folder-2', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
list.files(path, recursive = TRUE, pattern = "^garamba__")
```


<br />

These `*_data.RData` files (counts serires) can be imported later by running the 
function `read_series()`.


```{r 'read-series', eval = FALSE}
a_buselaphus <- popbayes::read_series("garamba__alcelaphus_buselaphus", path = path)
```


<br />



## 4. Fitting Bayesian model


The demographic potential of a species is limited. The intrinsic rate of 
increase `rmax` is the maximum increase in log population size that a species 
can attain in a year.

We strongly recommend providing these `rmax` values while estimating population 
trend to limit yearly population growth estimated by the model.

According to Sinclair (2003), `rmax` is related to the body mass of adult 
females `W`  by the formula:

$$ rmax = 1.375 \times W^{-0.315} $$

Body masses are found in the literature in publications such as Kingdon & 
Hoffman (2013), Cornelis _et al._ (2014), Illius & Gordon (1992), 
Sinclair (1996), Suraud _et al._ (2012), or Foley & Faust (2010). 
Alternatively, `rmax` can be obtained from previous demographic analyses.

<br />

The package `popbayes` provides the `rmax` values for the same 15 African mammals
species listed previously. These values are available in the dataset `rmax_data`.

<br />

```{r 'rmax-data'}
data("rmax_data")
```


**!!! BOOKMARK !!!**


<br />

```{r 'print-data-3', echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(rmax_data, caption = "Rmax data available in popbayes", 
             align = c("l", "r"))
```









```{r 'run-jags', eval = FALSE}
a_buselaphus_bugs <- popbayes::fit_trend(a_buselaphus, path = path)
```


```{r 'diagnostic', echo = -1}
a_buselaphus_bugs <- popbayes::read_bugs("garamba__alcelaphus_buselaphus", path = "docs/")
diagnostic(a_buselaphus_bugs)
```

```{r 'plot-trend-1',  fig.width=12, fig.height=6, out.width="100%", eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
popbayes::plot_trend("garamba__alcelaphus_buselaphus", path = path)
```

```{r 'plot-trend-2',  fig.width=12, fig.height=6, out.width="100%", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
popbayes::plot_trend("garamba__alcelaphus_buselaphus", path = "docs/")
```

<br />

Other functions: `popbayes::read_series()`, `popbayes::list_series()`, 
`popbayes::read_bugs()`, `popbayes::bugs_to_df()`.
