Description: Infers the trends of one or several populations over time from 
    series of counts. It does so by accounting for count precisions (provided 
    or inferred based on expert knowledge, e.g. for guesstimates), smoothing 
    the population rate of increase over time, and accounting for the maximum 
    demographic potential of species. Inference is carried out in a Bayesian 
    framework.
